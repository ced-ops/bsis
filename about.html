    <div class="overview">
        <p>BSIS typically stands for Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, a degree that combines business and technology to prepare students for careers in IT and systems management. 
            It focuses on subjects like data analysis, programming, systems design, cybersecurity, database management, and how information technology supports strategic business goals. 
            Graduates are equipped to work as systems analysts, IT consultants, data analysts, and software developers in a wide range of industries. Alternatively, in California, BSIS refers to the
             Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, a state agency under the Department of Consumer Affairs that licenses and regulates private security guards, private investigators, alarm company operators, 
             locksmiths, and related professions. 
            The agency ensures public safety and professional accountability through background checks, training requirements, and compliance enforcement. The meaning of BSIS depends on the contextâ€”either in the realm of higher 
            education or state-level regulatory services.
